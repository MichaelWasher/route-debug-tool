# Route Debug Tool
A tool to check the current network configuration of OpenShift Routes, Services and Pods.

This tool inspects the Pod definitions of an application and ensures the application is listening on the expected ports.

After checking the Pods, Service objects are compared with their associated Pods.
TODO: After checking the Services, Route objects are compared with their associated Service -> Pods.

NOTE: This currently assumes the application is used TCP ports with HTTP endpoints.
